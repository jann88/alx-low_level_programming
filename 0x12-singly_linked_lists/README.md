-data structures are a way of structuring data in order to efficiently store,find and create data, depending on the task at hand. Collection of similar or different data types.
Data structures types;
Linear data structures
- data is stored sequentially in linear data structures.
- rudimental structures since elements are stored one after the other without applying any mathematical operations.
- easy to implement but mem allocation might become complex, time and space complexities increase.
exampls; arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues
divided further;
-Static 
- in static linear data structures the memory allocation is not scalable. once entire memory is used no more space can be retrieved to store data. eg ; array
Dynamic
- memory allocation can be done dynamically when required. these data structures are efficient considering space complexity of the program.
eg; linkedlists stacks, queue
Non-linear data structures
- store data in the form of a hierarchy.
eg; graphs, trees, tries, maps
-Data defination defines a particular data with the following xtics:
Atomic - definition should define a single concept
Traceable - definition should be able to be mapped to some data element
Accurate - definition should be unambiguous
Clear and consise - definition should be understandable.
-Data object - represents an object having data
-Data type - refers to ways to classify various types of data such as integer, string.Nature of the data
classifed as ;
Built-in data type - those that languages has built in support. integers, boolean, floating, characters and strings.
Derived data type- types that are implementation independent.
list , array, stack, queue.

Basic operations
- The data in data structures are processed by certain operations.
Traversing, searching, insertion, deletion, sorting, merging
